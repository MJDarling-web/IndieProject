## User Login and Profile Management
### User Registration

## Transportation Comparison
### Car Ownership Costs
_As a user, I want to input the costs associated with owning a car (e.g., maintenance, gas, insurance, payment if applicable) so that I can accurately compare it to alternative modes of transportation. And I want to do this on the main page without having to make an account._

### Multiple forms of transport, update and change inputs
_As a user who lives in an area with different seasons, I want to be able to see how much I could save based on a multiple of different types of transportation._

### Alternative Transportation Costs
_As a user, I want to see cost auto generated for alternative transportation based on my commute distance (maybe commute is auto calculated based on Google Maps API for bus/public transit, or biking, or uber) compared to calculated cost of car ownership. For example walking would be $A-Pair-Of-Shoes/12 for a year = per month, or a bike already owned showed as yearly maintaince divided by 12 for a year. Like $120/12 = $10/month for bike vs default car ownership being $120 for an owned car and $380/month for a general finance or lease with data on page._

### Time (and health impact?)
