### Alternative Transportation Costs
_As a registered user, I want to see cost auto generated for alternative transportation based on my commute distance (maybe commute is auto calculated based on Google Maps API for bus/public transit, or biking, or uber) compared to calculated cost of car ownership. For example walking would be $A-Pair-Of-Shoes/12 for a year = per month, or a bike already owned showed as yearly maintenance divided by 12 for a year. Like $120/12 = $10/month for bike vs default car ownership being $120 for an owned car and $380/month for a general finance or lease with data on page._
