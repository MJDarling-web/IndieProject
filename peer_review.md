|--------|---------|-----|
||| Reviewer comments and suggestions go here. Each item should have *at least* one "kudos" and two suggestions for improvement  |
|**Problem Statement**|1. Accurately describes project purpose<br> 2. Is professional and free of typos, slang, etc.<br> 3. Fully explains the problem and the solution<br> 4. Is understandable by the average person| Kudos, problem statement is stated clearly and project mission is clear, is free of typos and slang, and is understandable to average person. If you want to expand on your problem statement you could break it down further you could break it down to problem statement and proposed solution as seperate pieces. You could also highlight the features within the problem statement such as users being able to make new tasts and their interaction with CRUD abilities. |
|**Design Documentation**|1. Navigation/flow through the application is logical and easy to use. <br>2. The order in which values are displayed are logical and easy to understand/use <br>3. The order in which the form fields entered are logical and easy to understand/use<br>4. All data discussed/documented (problem statement, flow, db design, etc.) is represented on the screens | DB design and your wireframes are beautifully easy to follow and understand, kudos! I really enjoyed learning about your use of Vertabelo and how you've utilized it for your own DB design, it's clear you're on the right path with your project here! The wireframes make sense and are clear to understand, solid header and design layout have gone into your project and it's clear you've thought the design out well! Only suggestion is to be open to the color options and be sure to review accessibility when you create your JSP pages, it's great that you've put your own creative color palette on your project and I like that it looks unique! Also, If the create task proves to be too small or a pop-up options isn't possible you could make it a separate page but I'm not sure if that's the layout you are going for. Great job thinking through the headers, footers, content, and page layouts, these look great!  |
|**Data model/Database**|1. Everything on the screens and problem statement/flow is represented in the model <br> 2. There is at least one 1-to-many relationship.<br> 3. The model represents good database design <br>| There are many 1-to-many relationships, database design is laid out well and easy to read! You have your files listed in the DBA file, great job all around! For the Lists table do you plan to let users to be able to make their own List tables with different titles/types ? Such as like having a Movie List, Cleaning Supplies List, Electrical or Utility Bill List? This is a good idea to allow users to have some extra customization! If it becomes to cumbersome with however many columns you may need in incorporate every type of list you could break it down further into the specific lists type that come to mind that you think users may want to use, or you could break it down to more general list types that users can give a different type to for each. For example, a "Shared-purchases" such as list 'household-cleaning-supplies' or 'groceries' may have cost columns associated with the lists while a tasks are probably just chores and no cost column are needed but date completed may be desired in a table for other tasks. I hope that makes sense and can help you further understand your use and desire for Lists table. | |
|**Code**|1. Proper Maven project structure is used<br> 2. a .gitignore file for IntelliJ Java projects has been implemented <br> 3. There is not any redundant or copy/paste code in the JSPs or classes<br> 4. Classes are appropriately-sized (no monster classes)<br> Property files are used appropriately: no hard-coded values <br> 5. Logging statements are used rather than System.out.println and printStackTrace.<br> 6. There are appropriate unit tests/code coverages. |   1/2. Maven project set up correctly with hibernate and log accurately being created on run as well as gitignore file has been implemented, kudos! 3. JSPs started, good job! You have some good wireframes to get started with when you dive into coding these. 4. code just started, good job focusing on the big picture and having your project environment setup for the project! I think your coding will come along fairly easily once are able to focus on them. 5/6 Logging file appears to be working correctly and no system.out.printlns that I saw, great job so far! This is a great start to your project and it's looking well prepared for your coding! Kudos! I've very impressed with your progress and mission of this project, can't wait to see your progress!   |
