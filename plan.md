started plan! Started to put it in Github as issues but wanted a more central space to view and review upcoming tasks instead of github issues

[x]Finish User Stories

[x]Creat Plan for project

[x]Update technologies used in project

[x]Finish wire frames of screens

[x]Project 1 Check Point Ready for review

Java Entity classes to implement 
Car Ownership Costs
[]Task 1: Create a form where users can input car ownership costs (maintenance, insurance, fuel, etc.).
[]Task 2: Validate user inputs and calculate total monthly car ownership cost.
[]Task 3: Implement backend logic to store the calculated costs for comparison with alternative transport options.
[]Task 4: Implement UI to display calculated ownership costs on the main page.
[]Task 5: Write unit tests to ensure proper calculation of car ownership costs.

Multiple Forms of Transport (Update and Change Inputs)
[]Task 1: Implement a user interface allowing users to select multiple modes of transportation (e.g., car, bike, bus).
[]Task 2: Implement dynamic cost calculators for each selected transport type.
[]Task 3: Implement logic to update and change transportation inputs dynamically (e.g., if the user changes the distance).
[]Task 4: Display the transportation cost comparisons side-by-side for the user.
[]Task 5: Write unit tests for updating transportation types and recalculating costs.
Alternative Transportation Costs
[]Task 1: Integrate with Google Maps API (or similar) to fetch public transit, taxi, and bike routes and calculate the distance and time for each mode.
[]Task 2: Create a formula to auto-calculate the cost of alternative transportation based on inputs (e.g., cost per mile for biking, bus fares).
[]Task 3: Allow users to input additional data for biking (e.g., bike maintenance cost) and walking (e.g., shoe cost).
[]Task 4: Display alternative transportation costs alongside car ownership costs.
[]Task 5: Write tests to ensure proper calculations for alternative transportation.

Time and Health Impact
[]Task 1: Implement a time tracking feature where users can log commute times for different transportation methods.
[]Task 2: Calculate the time spent commuting for each transportation type and display it.
[]Task 3: Integrate health-related data (optional) based on transportation type (e.g., calories burned for biking/walking).
[]Task 4: Implement UI to display time and health impact data in a user-friendly way.
[]Task 5: Write tests to ensure accurate tracking and calculation of time and health impact.

User Logging
[]Task 1: Create a log page where users can input and view their monthly commute details (mode of transport, time spent, cost).
[]Task 2: Implement backend storage for user commute logs.
[]Task 3: Allow users to view past logs and make updates to them.
[]Task 4: Display the cumulative cost and time spent for the userâ€™s commute over a period.
[]Task 5: Write tests for the logging functionality.

Future Impact Calculations - 1-Year, 2-Year, and 5-Year Projections
[]Task 1: Implement a financial projection model based on current transportation costs.
[]Task 2: Create a projection formula that factors in car depreciation, fuel price changes, and other variables for 1, 2, and 5 years.
[]Task 3: Integrate Google Charts API to visually display the projections in a graph format.
[]Task 4: Implement an interactive chart that updates based on user inputs (e.g., changing the cost of gas, car payment, etc.).
[]Task 5: Write tests to ensure proper functionality of the projections, including edge cases (e.g., no data entered, incorrect data).
