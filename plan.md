- 
> Indie project 
- [ ] check point 3

- **suggestions for module 3 to stay on time:**
- [ ] Create all entities and daos (remember to use a generic/abstract dao to minimize the number of daos you need to write)
- [ ] Display your entities on your jsps - essentially, have the data view pages complete, i.e. you should be able to view data (from the database) on your jsps 
- [ ] Begin implementing add/edit functionality 
- [ ] The site is professional-looking (CSS, Bootstrap or some other framework is implemented) 
- [ ] If you are using a public api/web service, call the service from your application to retrieve the data you need (you may not have the response mapped to objects yet, but you can at least see the data is correctly returned)
- [ ] Implement all changes based on peer and instructor feedback 
- [ ] Write unit tests for all non-entity/non-servlet classes. If your servlets perform significant bits of logic, put that code into testable classes or methods.

## Java Entity classes to implement 

### Car Ownership Costs
- [ ] Task 1: Create a form where users can input car ownership costs (maintenance, insurance, fuel, etc.).
- [ ] Task 2: Validate user inputs and calculate total monthly car ownership cost.
- [ ] Task 3: Implement backend logic to store the calculated costs for comparison with alternative transport options.
- [ ] Task 4: Implement UI to display calculated ownership costs on the main page.
- [ ] Task 5: Write unit tests to ensure proper calculation of car ownership costs.

### Multiple Forms of Transport (Update and Change Inputs)
- [ ] Task 1: Implement a user interface allowing users to select multiple modes of transportation (e.g., car, bike, bus).
- [ ] Task 2: Implement dynamic cost calculators for each selected transport type.
- [ ] Task 3: Implement logic to update and change transportation inputs dynamically (e.g., if the user changes the distance).
- [ ] Task 4: Display the transportation cost comparisons side-by-side for the user.
- [ ] Task 5: Write unit tests for updating transportation types and recalculating costs.
Alternative Transportation Costs
- [ ] Task 1: Integrate with Google Maps API (or similar) to fetch public transit, taxi, and bike routes and calculate the distance and time for each mode.
- [ ] Task 2: Create a formula to auto-calculate the cost of alternative transportation based on inputs (e.g., cost per mile for biking, bus fares).
- [ ] Task 3: Allow users to input additional data for biking (e.g., bike maintenance cost) and walking (e.g., shoe cost).
- [ ] Task 4: Display alternative transportation costs alongside car ownership costs.
- [ ] Task 5: Write tests to ensure proper calculations for alternative transportation.

## Time and Health Impact
- [ ] Task 1: Implement a time tracking feature where users can log commute times for different transportation methods.
- [ ] Task 2: Calculate the time spent commuting for each transportation type and display it.
- [ ] Task 3: Integrate health-related data (optional) based on transportation type (e.g., calories burned for biking/walking).
- [ ] Task 4: Implement UI to display time and health impact data in a user-friendly way.
- [ ] Task 5: Write tests to ensure accurate tracking and calculation of time and health impact.

## User Logging
- [ ] Task 1: Create a log page where users can input and view their monthly commute details (mode of transport, time spent, cost).
- [ ] Task 2: Implement backend storage for user commute logs.
- [ ] Task 3: Allow users to view past logs and make updates to them.
- [ ] Task 4: Display the cumulative cost and time spent for the userâ€™s commute over a period.
- [ ] Task 5: Write tests for the logging functionality.

## Future Impact Calculations - 1-Year, 2-Year, and 5-Year Projections
- [ ] Task 1: Implement a financial projection model based on current transportation costs.
- [ ] Task 2: Create a projection formula that factors in car depreciation, fuel price changes, and other variables for 1, 2, and 5 years.
- [ ] Task 3: Integrate Google Charts API to visually display the projections in a graph format.
- [ ] Task 4: Implement an interactive chart that updates based on user inputs (e.g., changing the cost of gas, car payment, etc.).
- [ ] Task 5: Write tests to ensure proper functionality of the projections, including edge cases (e.g., no data entered, incorrect data).
